    STRATEGY RULES: 
    IMPORTANT: You should set your time zone on the charts to EST / New York time.
    
    ENTRY RULES:
        We look for trades only between 21:30 and 23:30. If a breakout occurs before or after this time
        window we donâ€™t take the trade.
        
    LONG / BUY TRADE:
        1. First look at the daily bar of the previous session and only take a long trade if the session
            closed higher than it opened - it was a white candle.
        2. Then a few hours later at 21:30 look for the highest price of the session so far. The
            session starts at 17:00 so at 21:30 look back at the previous 4.5 hours and use the
            highest price.
        3. Place a Buy Stop order at that highest session price.
        4. Place a Stop Loss 150 pips away from your entry.
    
    SHORT SELL TRADE:
        1. First look at the daily bar of the previous session and only take a short trade if the
            session closed lower than it opened - it was a black candle.
        2. Then a few hours later at 21:30 look for the lowest price of the session so far. The
            session starts at 17:00 so at 21:30 look back at the previous 4.5 hours and use the
            lowest price.
        3. Place a SellShort Stop order at that lowest session price.
        4. Place a Stop Loss 150 pips away from your entry.
    
    EXIT RULES:
        Simple exits often work the best!
        Whether Long or Short exit the trade at the end of the session. I like to exit around 16:50 (about
        10 minutes before the session end).
        You will also have a 150 pip stop loss as an exit if the trade goes too far against you.
